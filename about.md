Hi there! I'm **Jonatas "jojo" Baldin** and this is my personal space to share what I'm doing and what I want to do.

I'm 25 years old (now I need to remember updating this every year...). I was born in Brazil, had a period of digital nomadism, lived in Cape Town and now I'm in Berlin ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

I'm a software and infrastructure engineer, focused in Python, Golang and Cloud Native technologies. I'm also into coffee, wine, running and plants ðŸŒ±

Besides working, I also **love** giving talks, attending to conferences and even help organizing them. You can take look at the communities sections in my [CV]({{ site.url }}/cv.html ).

You can reach me at [Twitter]({{ site.author.twitter }}), [Github]({{ site.author.github }}), [Youtube]({{ site.author.youtube }}) or [Email](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I hope you really enjoy the reading, and if have any feedback, do not hesitate to shout it at me!
